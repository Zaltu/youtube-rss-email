# youtube-rss-email
For some unknown reason, the corporate reptilian masterminds at google have decided that people don't actually want to use youtube and have removed email notifications for new videos uploaded by content creators you are subscribed to. This begs the question what the point of the notification bell or the subscriptions are even for now. Naturally, it would be rediculous to expect them to back off on any bad decisions made, so we need to fix it ourselves.

## Use
This script keeps up-to-date of new uploads from selectable youtube channels by pinging the RSS feed representing those channels. It then emails a list of subscribed users, also configurable. It can be run as an AIGIS plugin, or a standalone daemon.

## TODO
- Actually implement the SMTP thing. Next week.
